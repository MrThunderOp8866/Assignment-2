    <main>
      <p>This night is cold in the kingdom</p>
      <p>I can feel you fade away</p>
      <p>From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
        Your steps keep me awake</p>
      <p>Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste</p>
      <p>I once was a man with dignity and grace</p>
      <p>Now I'm slippin' through the cracks of your cold embrace
        So please, please</p>
      <p>Could you find a way to let me down slowly?</p>
      <p>A little sympathy, I hope you can show me</p>
      <p>If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely</p>
      <p>If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly</p>
      <p>Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
        Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down</p>
      <p>If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
        If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly</p>
      <p>Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
        As I'm walking down the corridor</p>
      <p>And I know we haven't talked in a while
        So I'm looking for an open door</p>
      <p>And I can't stop myself from fallin' (down) down
        And I can't stop myself from fallin' (down) down
        And I can't stop myself from fallin' (down) down
        And I can't stop myself from fallin' (down) down</p>
      <p>Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
        Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down</p>
      <p>If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
        If you're leavin', baby, let me down slowly</p>
